One of the realities of bringing technology into pretty much anywhere else is that you notice just how far apart everything is. The way that some industries and professions - and even just regular folks - use technology in their daily lives is many miles away from the newest, most cutting-edge, coolest design trends and programming trends today.

The leading edge really does become the "bleeding edge" when the latest and greatest just do not translate into real-world usefulness. And that is something for which everyone - designers, developers, consumers, industry leaders - are collectively responsible. For example, in my other world, the organized real estate, the gaps are wide and long. As such an entrepreneurial field, some practitioners are on top of the latest apps and geeking out on great tech solutions, while others are stubbornly ensconced in their IE6 browsers and happy to see as little change as possible. Meanwhile, big-game firms like [Trulia](http://www.trulia.com) and [Zillow](http://www.zillow.com) are bringing fierce competition and forcing the real estate industry to innovate, and fast.

In this kind of space, web design and web development may work best - and most profitably - by closing those gaps, one at a time. In business school we learn that profits and benefits can come from points of inefficiency and pain. There is plenty to go around in this field for someone who knows the real estate industry and its myriad politics, and who can manage an agile development team.
