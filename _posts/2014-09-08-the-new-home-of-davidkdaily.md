After a period of some silence, the blog that was launched in 2009 as [The Writer, Block'd](http://blockd.wordpress.com) and  renamed to DavidKDaily has now moved to a new host. After years of hosting on Wordpress.com, DavidKDaily is expanding into a few different directions. For starters, my technology writing and portfolio will be hosted on this GitHub site running the very cool Jekyll static site generator. For those of you who love languages like I do, note that this site exists thanks to an alphabet soup of languages and tech tools beyond HTML and CSS: SASS, Liquid, Markdown, Ruby, YAML. Just for starters. 

But don't let your eyes glaze over; in future posts I'll talk about how cool the current web design and language scene is. It is like learning a new language or playing a musical instrument. It's like a salesperson successful closing a big sale and then wonder how it all worked and how he or she can do it again. It's like learning a new recipe and serving your guests to wild applause. Yep, it's all that.

Have you thought about the last time your business brought applause from your customers and clients? Do you know where they are? Who they are? Now might be a good time to check in.

In the future, DavidKDaily will relaunch Block'd and share my portfolio of projects. As a professional in external affairs, I work with governments of all shapes and sizes, as well as the media, the public, and groups of all kinds who are dedicated to improving your community. With my experience in PR and corporate communications, I use web design to reach your audience.

Check back often to see what's new at DavidKDaily and in the world of technology, public policy, and community. Meanwhile, head over to [So There's That](http://sotheresthatblog.com), a lifestyle collaboration with professional photographer [Charla Avery](http://www.charlablue.com).
