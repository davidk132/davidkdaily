<h2>About Me</h2> 

By day I am a real estate lobbyist. I work in government advocacy, public relations and external affairs. I have published articles in several media outlets and I love good writing. How does one learn to write, you ask? The answer: Get a pen and a piece of paper, and open a vein.

For more than eight years I have worked in government advocacy with the Realtor profession. My home base is the South Bay Association of REALTORS in Torrance, Calif. I work closely with the California Association of REALTORS and the National Association of REALTORS in order to help REALTORS all over the U.S. help their clients buy a home.

I also am a professional writer, publicist and web designer. Contact me for more information about your current project or just to say hi at one of my social media accounts below.
